# Musings on the term so far.

Ideas, thoughts, questions, paragraphs on how things are going & what this class is making the professor think about.

> Some projects are bigger than companies. The Internet, for example, could never have happened as a consumer product. The Internet was incubated in a non-commercial research culture for decades. By the time a trillion-dollar industry grew around it, a set of core values (decentralization, equal access for all) were embedded in the core protocols, and are still recognized today as ideals worth fighting for. This is our model.

## On Installing Inkscape.

There are some serious barriers to entry. On the linux systems I setup, installing these things is pretty easy -- I mean, if you are willing to use the terminal and commandline interface for installing and updating. But man, on my Mac, some of this stuff is way more complicated. At first I tried the Homebrew method. But, just kept running into problems. That meant I had to solve homebrew and general system configuration problems before I could even install inkscape correctly.

It also is not ported from x11, so you have to still run Xquartz (like with FontForge) to get things running...

whew.

This is more than the average person wants to put up with. However, should I have the expectation that this isn't something I'll have to put up with? Is the issue more that the instructions are distributed and not all together in one place, and that there is so much other non-intuitive stuff going on?

Woah. Key command memory is hard to unlearn as well. I got everything installed. Had to default to the installer, running an old Xcode and some issue of writing permissions ... Hard to do things. whew.

This should probably be a better reporting; but its not.
